### Inventory mouse rules

- Left click: pick up / swap / merge a stack

- Shift+click: quick-move between areas (into furnace slots, hotbar ↔ backpack)
- Shift+click a craft result: craft as many as fit into your inventory
- Click outside the window: throw the cursor stack on the ground

## Mining rules

- Each block has a hardness and an optional preferred tool class.
- Better tool tiers mine faster; some blocks need a minimum tier to drop
  anything (iron needs stone+, gold/diamond/redstone need iron+, obsidian
  needs diamond).
- Tools lose 1 durability per block or hit; the bar under the icon shows wear.
